Hi, I'm Devasenan, adaptable logician. A second-year student of KCT. A Machine Learning enthusiast and have explored a bit of OpenCV and Numpy packages.

I have also done some projects on web development using Django, interesting ones are a typing practice website(https://funtype.pythonanywhere.com/) and a Movie recommending website(https://mrsapp.pythonanywhere.com/). 
And other than this I also love to solve problems on Hackerrank in problem-solving, python, and more.
